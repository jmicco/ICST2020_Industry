ICST 2020 invites high quality submissions in all areas of software testing, verification, and validation. The industry track has the same topics and requires the same rigorousness as the research track. However, the industry track papers should prioritize impact and realism over novelty. We expect that industry track publications report useful testing tools, successful stories and experiences when applying software testing theories and methodologies into practice, or promising prototypes that have the potential to impact practice in the next few years. Ideally they should be evaluated on real-world, industrial data, and discuss non-functional aspects such as scalability and reliability, and also compare to pre-existing industrial best practices. The industry track papers will be published in the ICST 2020 proceedings and listed by IEEE databases.

Topics of interest include, but is not limited to, the following:

- Domain specific testing, such as: Autonomous vehicles, advanced control systems, mobile or web app testing, embedded systems testing, concurrent systems, GUI testing, etc.
- Formal verification
- Model based testing
- Model checking
- Search based software testing
- Security testing
- Software reliability
- Test automation
- Testability and design
- Testing and development processes
- Testing education
- Testing / debugging frameworks and tools
- Applications of software testing theories in practice
- Empirical studies
- Experience reports

Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the ICST Program Committee.

**Format**

Industry papers must conform to the two-column IEEE conference publication format. Templates for LaTeX and Microsoft Word are available from [http://www.ieee.org/conferences\_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html](http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html): please use the letter format template and conference option.

Papers should be submitted in the PDF format: they must not exceed ten pages, plus up to two pages of references. Submissions will be handled via EasyChair.

Papers must neither have been previously accepted for publication nor be under submission in another conference or journal.

For your paper to be published in the ICST 2020 conference proceedings, at least one of the authors of the paper must register for the conference and confirm that she/he will present the paper in person.

**Double Blind**

Industry track papers do **not** need to be double-blinded. Since industry papers typically rely heavily on the industrial/practical context in which the work was carried out it would be too much to ask to require this context to be anonymized. Please contact the industry track chairs if you have more questions.

**FAQ**

**Q:**  **Does the industry track accept abstracts or short papers****?**

**A:** No. The industry track has the same rigorousness as the research papers, therefore, the industry track papers need to present the motivation, methodology, design of experiments / case studies, results, discussions, and related work in a clear and comprehensive way. Abstracts or short papers don&#39;t have enough room to incorporate these required and important contents.

**Q: My paper has less than 10 pages, can I submit it to the industry track?**

**A:** Yes, as long as your paper clearly presents the motivation, methodology, design of experiments / case studies, results, discussions, and related work.
